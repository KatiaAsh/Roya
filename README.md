# Roya رؤيا

#### Problem
Arab students in Israel are currently leaving high school without a sufficient understanding of career paths most suited for their ability and personality. In an attempt to address this, schools put their students through numerous aptitude and personality tests, most of which are self-reported questionnaires.

While these tests can be useful, users may have bias ideals of themselves that are not necessarily correct. Overall, it does not give accurate representation of the user and their true strengths and weaknesses.

#### Mission Statement
Roya is derived from the Arabic word ‘رؤيا’, which means revelation.

Roya is a platform to help reveal students’ cognitive and emotional make-up objectively through series of games. This in turn will help them make better decisions about their career paths.


#### Objectives
- Revolutionize assessment tests
    - Engage users in interactive games backed by neuroscience
- Better representation of user
    - Give insight about the user’s greatest strengths and weaknesses
- Better educational choices
    - Help users find degrees that matches their objective traits


### Target Audiences
The main users of this App are students between the ages of 18 - 24. Career counselors and schools will also benefit from this app.
