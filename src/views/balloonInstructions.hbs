        The goal of this game is to earn as much money as possible. You will be presented with 20 deflated balloons, one at a time. <br><br>

        For each balloon you earn 0.10 shekels per pump. To permanently collect the coins, click “Collect money”. <br><br>

        Each balloon has a explosion point. If the balloon explodes before you click “Collect money”, you will lose all potential shekels. <br><br>
