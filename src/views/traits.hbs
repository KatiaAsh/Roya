          <p>You are motivated by external rewards, which increases your capacity to be goal-oriented and achieve the outcomes expected by your company. Remember, however, that intrinsic motivation plays a key role in fueling long-term motivation. Try to
            seriously think about what interests you and drives you. This will be beneficial for your performance and life satisfaction.</p>

        <div class="content-text">
          <p>When faced with an ambiguous task, you adopt a trail-and-error method and learn well from your mistakes. That said, this position may require you to stick to a single (or limited number of) strategies. Excessive exploration of multiple strategies
            may prevent you from effectively completing the task at hand, and instead you will need to develop a more steady focus.</p>

        <div class="content-text">
          <p>You are an efficient planner, quick to choose a correct strategy. This trait is advantageous because you tend to be quick at making good decisions, but be careful not to become complacent and default to quick planning for all tasks-some may
            benefit from slower, more deliberate planning, especially if it is more demanding or nuanced. This position will have many such tasks.</p>

        <div class="content-text">
          <p>You are trusting of others. This is a prosocial trait that yields many benefits to you and those around you. That said, in this position, there may be many tasks where increased skepticism is beneficial. This sort of skepticism is not meant
            to elicit toxic suspicion, but rather it promotes a quick evaluation of the credibility and reliability of those around, before engaging in work with them.</p>
